# Detection-of-cardiovascular-disease-using-ANN
Developed a deep learning model using ANN to detect cardiovascular disease from ECG images preprocessed ECG images with OpenCV and image augmentation techniques Trained the ANN model using different datasets Evaluated performance using accuracy,precision,recall,and F1-score for accurate disease prediction
